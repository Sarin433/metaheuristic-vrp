# Greeting
Hello everyone who visit. This repository is the side project to learn about metaheurictis that focus to solve vehicle routing problems.

# Data
### In this project use Solomon Vehicle Routing Problem
- C1
- C2
- R1
- R2
- RC1
- RC2

# Algorithm
The algorithms use the original algorithm. No combination between algorithms or enhancement.
- Genetic Algorithm (GA) (in testing)
- Particle swarm optimization (PSO) (in progress)
- Slime mould algorithm (SMA) (in progress)
- Artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA) (in research)

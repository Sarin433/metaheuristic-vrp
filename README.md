# Greeting
Hello everyone who visit. This repository is the side project to learn about metaheurictis that focus to solve vehicle routing problems.

# Data
In this project use Solomon Vehicle Routing with Time Window Problem (VRPTW) but I cut the Time Window off then it will be the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).
The problems are consist of two different setup with Six main types (R1, R2, C1, C2, RC1, RC2) with random (R), clustered (C), or mixed (RC) customer locations, with coordinates identical within each type.
- C1, R1, RC1 (Short scheduling horizon, fewer customers per route.)
- C2, R2, RC2 (Long scheduling horizon, allowing many customers per route. )


# Algorithm
The algorithms use the original algorithm. No combination between algorithms or enhancement.
- Genetic Algorithm (GA) (in testing)
- Particle swarm optimization (PSO) (in progress)
- Slime mould algorithm (SMA) (in progress)
- Artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA) (in research)
- Grey Wolf Optimation (GWO) (in research)

# Evalation
- Computational Time
- Average distance (shorter is better)
